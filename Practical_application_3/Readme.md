DataÂ¶
Bank Marketing: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing
Dataset Information Additional Information
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.


Data Processing
Standscaled all the numerical columns
Onehotencoding all the categorical columns
One-time holdout validation

Findings
The accuracy score are very close to each other for all 4 classifiers, Logistic refression and DecisionTree took the lower the fitting time.
Logistic Regression is the best with highest test score and relatively less fitting time.
DecisonTree is good for the logic interpreation.
